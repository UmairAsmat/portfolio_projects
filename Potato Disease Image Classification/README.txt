Implemented a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. 
The project involves the classification of plant diseases using a dataset called PlantVillage. 
Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers, including convolutional and pooling layers, 
followed by fully connected layers for classification. The model was compiled and trained using the training and validation datasets. 
Used the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function
